**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Help me help you**
If you encounter an error, please make sure to go to "Help" on the top ribbon and select "Toggle Developer Tools" (make sure you reproduced the error first of course). Make sure you are on the console tab of the newly opened dev console and click on one of the entries and click ctrl + a to highlight all the console logs and ctrl + c to copy them. Please share this copied text with me, it can help a lot! Likewise a screenshot of your settings page in vscode is helpful. Please try to get a screenshot  of your setting (both user and workplace!) when submitting a bug. If you could get one from when you first launch the extension as well as when you encounter the error, that would be incredible helpful. To get a screen shot, press ctrl + , and then type bg3 to show all the bg3 mod helper related settings. Besure to swap between workplace and user settings to get both,
